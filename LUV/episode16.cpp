CONSTRAINTS:
1 ≤ t ≤ 10
1 ≤ N, Q ≤ 100000
1 ≤ L ≤ R ≤ N
'a' ≤ S[i] ≤ 'z' for 1 ≤ i ≤ N

INPUT:
First line contains an integer t denoting the number of test cases
First line of each test case contains 2 space separated integers N and Q, the length of the string and number of queries respectively
Next line contains the string S
Each of the Next Q lines contain 2 space separated integers L and R

OUTPUT:
For each query of each test case print "YES" without quotes 
if letters of the substring from L to R can be rearranged to form a palindrome 
otherwise output "NO" in new line
