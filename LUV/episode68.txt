Graph is a collection of edges and vertices.
These edges can be bidirectional or unidirectional.

Graph without any cycle is called a tree.
If a tree has n nodes, then the number of edges will be n-1.

Connected Components:
We can traverse every single node from any node in a connected component.

Simple Graphs are undirected graphs.       ------
In directed graphs, edges have a direction ------>

In directed graphs, connected Components are termed as Strongly Connected Components.

collection of connected components is called as forest.

In a tree, distance of any node from a root node is called as depth of that node.
Height of a node is the longest possible number of edges to the leaf node.
LCA is the first common parent of two nodes.
